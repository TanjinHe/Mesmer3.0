Need to think about condition where the pressure is very low. As in Mesmer, the current setting is that the excess reactant 
concentration is fixed in all pressure and temperature, there should be cases where the total pressure is lower than the
excess reactant concentration, which runs into an error.

Moved countDimerCellDOS() to MesmerMath. The idea is to clean this DOSC method class to an extent that it can be 
called repeatedly. Therofore, all unrelated internal methods should be isolated out from this class.
